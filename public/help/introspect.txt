Token introspection
-------------------

Endpoint:
	https://<server>/auth/v1/introspect

Methods:
	POST

Description:
	This API is used to validate an access token provided by a consumer.

Called by:
	A "resource-server" with a valid class-1 certificate.

	Note-1:
	The "CN" of the resource-server certificate should be valid hostname
	(FQDN) or IP address. And it must be ensured that the IP address of the
	"CN" matches with the machine that makes the introspect call.

	Note-2:
	This API must be only called by the resource-server after ensuring that
	the "resource-ids" requested by consumer is valid.

Headers:
	content-type	: "application/json"

Body:
	token		: <token presented by the consumer>
	server-token	: <server token presented by the consumer> // optional

HTTP response code:

	200
		If the token is valid

	403
		If the token is invalid/expired

			-OR-

		The "CN" of the resource-server certificate does not match the
		IP address of the machine which is calling this API.

	429
		If the resource-server makes too many requests

Using pyIUDX SDK:
