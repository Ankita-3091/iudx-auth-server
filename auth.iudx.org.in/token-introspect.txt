Token introspection
-------------------

Endpoint:
	https://<server>/auth/v1/introspect

Methods:
	POST

Description:
	This API is used to validate an access token provided by a consumer.

Called by:
	A "resource-server" with a valid class-1 certificate.

	Note-1:
	The "CN" of the resource-server certificate should be valid hostname
	(FQDN) or IP address. And it must be ensured that the IP address of the
	"CN" matches with the machine that makes the introspect call.

	Note-2:
	This API must be only called by the resource-server after ensuring that
	the "resource-ids" requested by consumer is valid.

Headers:
	content-type	: "application/json"

Body:
	token		: <token presented by the consumer>
	server-token	: <server token presented by the consumer> // optional

Checks before making the API call:

	A valid IUDX token consist of 3 fields (delimited by '/'):

		1. Who has issued the token (The Auth server)
		2. To whom the token has been issued (The consumer)
		3. Random string 

	For example:
		auth.iudx.org.in/user@domain.com/1802a84d157ff4d113150aeca8bdacee 

	[NOTE] : It is important for a resource-server to check if the token was
	issued by a trusted Auth server before making the introspect call.

	That is - Do NOT create the Auth server URL based on the token provided by
	the consumer.

HTTP response code:

	200
		If the token is valid

	403
		If the token is invalid/expired

			-OR-

		The "CN" of the resource-server certificate does not match the
		IP address of the machine which is calling this API.

	429
		If the resource-server makes too many requests

Using pyIUDX SDK:

	Example 1:

		# simple example 

		from pyIUDX.auth import auth

		iudx_auth = auth.Auth("resource-server-certificate.pem","private-key.pem")

		iudx_auth.introspect_token("auth.iudx.org.in/arun.babu@rbccps.org/2204adcbc990ffff234689aaabcdef90")

	Example 2:

		# dealing with untrusted auth servers

		from pyIUDX.auth import auth

		cert = "resource-server-certificate.pem"
		key  = "private-key.pem"

		my_trusted_auth_servers = {
			"auth.iudx.org.in"	: auth.Auth(cert,key,"auth.iudx.org.in"),
			"my.auth.server.com"	: auth.Auth(cert,key,"my.auth.server.com"),
			"third.party.auth.com"	: auth.Auth(cert,key,"third.party.auth.com"),
		}

		# received token from consumer
		token = "auth.iudx.org.in/arun.babu@rbccps.org/2204adcbc990ffff234689aaabcdef90"

		try:
			token_auth_server = token.split("/")[0]
			auth_server = my_trusted_auth_servers [token_auth_server]
			print(valid_auth_server.introspect_token(token))
		except:
			print("Invalid token")

CURL example:

	Request:

		curl -XPOST https://auth.iudx.org.in/auth/v1/introspect					\

			--cert resource-server-certificate.pem --key private-key.pem			\

			-H 'content-type: application/json'						\

			-d '{"token": "auth.iudx.org.in/arun.babu@rbccps.org/2204adcbc990ffff234689aaabcdef90"}'

	Response:

		200 OK

		{
			"consumer"			: "arun.babu@rbccps.org",
			"consumer-certificate-class"	: 3

			"expiry"			: "2019-12-12T04:29:50.779Z",

			"request" : [
					{
					  "resource-id": "example.com/9cf2c2382cf661fc20a4776345a3be7a143a109c/rs1.com/r3",
					  "apis": ["/*"],
					  "methods": ["*"]
					}
			],
		}

	Response fields:

		1. consumer:
			The consumer's email-id.

		2. consumer-certificate-class
			The class of certificate used by the consumer to get the
			token.

		3. expiry:
			Indicates till what time the token is valid.

		4. request:
			The list of resource-id's, methods, and APIs for which
			the token is valid.
