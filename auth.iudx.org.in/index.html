<b>1. Introduction</b>

	Welcome to the <a href="https://www.iudx.org.in">IUDX</a> Authentication, Authentication, and Accounting (AAA) server.

	This server serves the IUDX AAA REST <a href="#apis">APIs</a> which can be called by:

		1. Data providers   (the resource owners)
		2. Data consumers   (users who wish to access one or more data provider's data)
		3. Resource servers (which hosts the data provider's data)

	through <a href="https://auth.iudx.org.in">HTTPS</a> (using a valid client-side <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a> certificate).

<b>2. Setup</b>

	<b><font color=red>[Note]</font></b> In the above setup, the <b>Resource server administrator</b> and the <b>Data provider</b> may also be the same person.

<b>3. Data access flow</b>

<b id=apis>4. APIs</b>

	The Auth APIs expect the METHOD to be POST.  

	Inputs/outputs if any, are expected to be in JSON.

	And returns:

		1. 200 on success
		2. 400 on bad request
		3. 403 on unauthorized request

	On exceptions:

		4. 402 on payment required (due to insufficient credits)
		5. 429 on too many requests
		6. 500 on internal error

	Below are the list of Auth APIs.

	 1. Get an access token (to be called by data consumers):
		<a href="token.txt">/auth/v1/token</a>

	 2. Set access control polcies (to be called by data providers):
		<a href="acl-set.txt">/auth/v1/acl/set</a>

	 3. Append to existing access control policies (to be called by data providers):
		<a href="acl-append.txt">/auth/v1/acl/append</a>

	 4. Get the current access control policies (to be called by data providers):
		<a href="acl.txt">/auth/v1/acl</a>

	 5. Validate an access token (to be called by resource servers):
		<a href="token-introspect.txt">/auth/v1/token/introspect</a>

	 6. Revoke tokens (can be called by both data providers and consumers):
		<a href="token-revoke.txt">/auth/v1/token/revoke</a>

	 7. Revoke all tokens for a given certificate (can be called by both data providers and consumers):
		<a href="token-revoke-all.txt">/auth/v1/token/revoke-all</a>

	 8. Audit tokens (can be called by both data providers and consumers):
		<a href="audit-tokens.txt">/auth/v1/audit/tokens</a>

	 9. Add a consumer to a group (to be called by a data provider):
		<a href="group-add.txt">/auth/v1/group/add</a>

	10. Delete a consumer from a group (to be called by a data provider):
		<a href="group-delete.txt">/auth/v1/group/delete</a>

	11. List current consumers in a group (to be called by a data provider):
		<a href="group-list.txt">/auth/v1/group/list</a>

	12. Get the user's certificate details (can be called by any user):
		<a href="certificate-info.txt">/auth/v1/certificate-info</a>

<b>5. Authentication</b>

	All APIs require a valid client-side certificate (X.509).

	Data providers and consumers <b>must</b> have a valid <b>emailAddress</b> field in the certificate.

	Where as, the resource server's certificate must have a valid hostname (FQDN) as the <b>Common Name (CN)</b>.
	Also, for a resource server, the hostname in the certificate <b>must</b> match with the IP from where the API is being called.

	To get a certificate, please visit any of the following certificate authorities (CA):

		1. IUDX certificate authority : <a href=https://ca.iudx.org.in>https://ca.iudx.org.in</a>
		2. Any licensed CA in India   : <a href=http://cca.gov.in/licensed_ca.html>http://cca.gov.in/licensed_ca.html</a>
		3. Any standard trusted CA    : <a href=./ca-list.txt>List of trusted certificate authorities</a>

	<b>Please note that</b>: as of now, certificates issued by CAs other than <a href="https://ca.iudx.org.in">IUDX CA</a> will be considered as:

		class-1 for resource servers.
		class-2 for consumers.

	If you wish to get a class-3 or above certificate, please use the <a href=https://ca.iudx.org.in>IUDX CA</a> or your organization's IUDX-subCA.

<b>6. Certificate classes</b>

	There are 5 classes of certificates:

		class-1: Can only be used by resource servers to validate/introspect their tokens.
			 They can <b>only</b> be used to call the <a href="token-introspect.txt">/auth/v1/token/introspect</a> API.

		class-2: Can be used by a data consumer to request access to <b>protected</b> data.
			 They can <b>only</b> be used to call the <a href="token.txt">/auth/v1/token</a> API.

		class-3: Can be used by a <b>data consumer</b> to request access to <b>protected</b> data.
			 Can be used by a <b>data provider</b> to set access control policies <b>and</b> create/manage catalog entries.

		class-4: Can be used by a data consumer to request access to <b>private</b> data.
		class-5: Can be used by a data consumer to request access to <b>confidential</b> data.
